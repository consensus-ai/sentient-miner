# sentient-miner
GPU miner for sia in go

All available opencl capable GPU's are detected and used in parallel.

## Binary releases

[Binaries for Windows and Linux are available in the corresponding releases](https://github.com/consensus-ai/sentient-miner/releases)


## Installation from source

### Prerequisites
* go version 1.4.2 or above (earlier version might work or not), check with `go version`
* opencl libraries on the library path
* gcc

```
go get github.com/consensus-ai/sentient-miner
```

## Run
```
sentient-miner
```

Usage:
```
  -url string
    	siad host and port (default "localhost:9980")
        for stratum servers, use `stratum+tcp://<host>:<port>`
  -user string
        username, most stratum servers take this in the form [payoutaddress].[rigname]
        This is optional, if solo mining sia, this is not needed
  -I int
    	Intensity (default 28)
  -E string
        Exclude GPU's: comma separated list of devicenumbers
  -cpu
    	If set, also use the CPU for mining, only GPU's are used by default
  -v	Show version and exit
```

See what intensity gives you the best hashrate, increasing the intensity also increases the stale rate though.

## Examples
**poolmining:**
`sentient-miner -url stratum+tcp://siamining.com:3333 -I 28 -user 9afafe46fbd4d2fc3f6dd61ae36686a8ce3d9ddd84a8c8fa72dddb5fe09e6e61f2e2e60f974c.example`

**solomining:**
start siad with the miner module enabled and start sentient-miner:
`siad -M cghrtwm`
`sentient-miner`

## Stratum support

Stratum support is implemented as defined on https://siamining.com/stratum

## Developer fee

A developer fee of 1% is created by submitting 1% of the shares for my address if using the stratum protocol. The code is open source so you can simply remove that line if you want to. To make it easy for you, the exact line is https://github.com/consensus-ai/sentient-miner/blob/master/algorithms/sia/siastratum.go#L307 if you do not want to support the sentient-miner development.

## FAQ
- ERROR fetching work - Status code 404

  If you are solomining, make siad is running and the miner module is enabled in siad: `siad -M cghrtwm`

- ERROR fetching work - Get http://localhost:9980/miner/header: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:9980: connection refused

  Make sure `siad` is running

- What is `siad`?

  Check the sia documentation

- I don't know how to set up siad or the sia UI wallet, how do I do that?

  Check the sia documentation.

- You have to help me set up mining SIA

  No I don't
